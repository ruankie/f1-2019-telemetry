F1 2019 UDP Telemetry package
=============================

The f1-2019-telemetry package provides support for interpreting telemetry information as sent out over the network by [the F1 2019 game by CodeMasters](http://www.codemasters.com/game/f1-2019/).
It also provides command-line tools to record, playback, and monitor F1 2019 session data.

With each yearly release of the F1 series game, CodeMasters post a descripton of the corresponding telemetry packet format on their forum.
For F1 2019, the packet format is described here: https://forums.codemasters.com/topic/38920-f1-2019-udp-specification/.

The package should work on Python 3.6 and above.
