Documentation of package f1-2019-telemetry
==========================================

The f1-2019-telemetry package implements support for interpreting telemetry information as sent out over the network by the F1 2019 game.
It also implements several small tools to record, playback, and monitor F1 2019 session data.

The core functionality is based on the CodeMasters Forum topic documenting the F1 2019 packet format: https://forums.codemasters.com/topic/38920-f1-2019-udp-specification/.

The package should work on Python 3.6 and above.
