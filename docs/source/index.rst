=========================================
Welcome to the f1-2019-telemetry package!
=========================================

The f1-2019-telemetry package implements support for interpreting telemetry information as sent out over the network by `the F1 2019 game by CodeMasters <http://www.codemasters.com/game/f1-2019/>`_.
It also implements several small :ref:`command line tools <command_line_tools>` to record, playback, and monitor F1 2019 session data.

The documentation comes in two parts:

* The :ref:`package-documentation` provides guidance on installation and usage of the f1-2019-telemetry package, as well as documentation of the command-line tools provided.
* The :ref:`telemetry-specification` is a non-authoritative copy of the CodeMasters telemetry packet specification, with some corrections applied.
